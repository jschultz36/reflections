How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff easily allowed me to see the changes between two versions of a file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would make it a lot easier to track changes that resulted in errors

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing would allow saving a version directly before making a change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    there may be dependencies on the multiple files. So only saving one would ultimately be useless

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Allows you to track differences and changes made between versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It would let you easily recover after making the change.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
